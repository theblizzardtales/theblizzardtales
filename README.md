### 📖Brief History about the tools used:

#### [Bash (Bourne Again SHell)](https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/Bash-Beginners-Guide.html)
It helped to learn how to use commands, create scripts, as well as to operate Linux just from the terminal.

#### [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
It was used for our subject, Computer Programming 2. I learned to create "Snake Game" by using [Java Swing.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-java-swing/)

#### [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website) and [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
It was used for our subject, Web System and Development. I learned how to create a simple website (which is beginner's guide for Java), with minimal usage of JavaScript.

#### [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/)
It made me realize that it wasn't only just Windows and macOS; there's also this penguin that somehow helped my Pentium to still be usable in this day and age.
